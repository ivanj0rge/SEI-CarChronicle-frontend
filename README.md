Description:

CarChronicle is a comprehensive web application developed during the final week of the General Assembly Software Engineering course. It is built using React.js for the frontend, Django Python for the backend, and a PostgreSQL database to store data. The project allows users to track vehicle information, claim ownership, and record maintenance activities.

Deployment link:

https://sei-carchronicle-frontend-production.up.railway.app/

Getting Started/Code Installation:

To explore the code and run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ivanj0rge/SEI-CarChronicle-frontend / https://github.com/ivanj0rge/SEI-CarChronicle-backend
Navigate to the project folder and set up the backend using Django migrations.
Install frontend dependencies with npm install and start the React development server with npm start.

Timeframe & Working Team:

I worked independently on the CarChronicle project during the last week of the GA Software Engineering course.

Technologies Used:

React.js
Django Python
PostgreSQL
External API for vehicle data retrieval
Brief:

The project brief was to create a full-stack web application using React.js and Django Python, integrating an external API to retrieve vehicle information. The application allows users to claim vehicle ownership, add maintenance records, and view a chronicle of their vehicle's history.

Planning:

During the planning stage, I created wireframes for the frontend, designed the backend data models using Django ORM, and utilized Trello for project management. The use of pseudocode helped structure the initial logic flow.

Build/Code Process:

The project was structured following a modular approach, with separate components for frontend and backend functionalities.

Challenges:

Integrating data from the external API and ensuring seamless synchronization with the database.
Managing state and ensuring smooth communication between React frontend and Django backend.

Wins:

Successful integration of the external API to retrieve accurate vehicle information.
Implemented a user-friendly interface for claiming ownership and recording maintenance activities.

Key Learnings/Takeaways:

Gained proficiency in using React.js for frontend development.
Enhanced skills in setting up and managing a Django backend with PostgreSQL.

Bugs:

No significant bugs to report.

Future Improvements:

Implement user authentication for personalized vehicle chronicles.
Enhance data validation and error handling mechanisms.
Add more features such as notifications for upcoming maintenance tasks.
